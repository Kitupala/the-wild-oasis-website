## Description
Website is designed for customers to reserve cabins at the fictional Wild Oasis rental company. App uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) Open Source SQL Database. The authentication process is carried out using [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) (OAuth). This [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project is part of the Udemy online course
[`The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Next.js, Redux & More`](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) _by_ Jonas Schmedtmann.
Most of the components were pre-build and styled but the main goal was to study Next.js with the modern "app" router (with React Server Components and Server Actions). As an additional challenge, I implemented the project using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
